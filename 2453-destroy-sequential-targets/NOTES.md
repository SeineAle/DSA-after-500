<h2>Approach</h2>
<b>first : </b>â€‹ 
<p>sorted the array so that bigger no are by default in last</p>
<b>Second : </b>
<p>represented every no as  (a*space) + b  and stored the remainder in the map</p>

<h3>Thaought process</h3>
<p>Sorting and starting fro back was always ckear but toook to much time to represent the no as modulo</p>
